oscillocalc
===========
oscillocalc is an android utility for easily calculating the voltage and frequency on a
analogue oscilloscope.

For Frequency Calculation:
	-Enter amount of divisions peak to peak on the first line.
	-Enter the time per division your scope is set to on the second line.
	-Set the time units for the time per division line.
	-Set the target frequency unit to output.
	
For Voltage Calculation:
	-Enter amount of divisions peak to peak one the first line.
	-Enter the voltage per division your scope is set to on the second line.
	-Set the voltage units for the volts per division line.
	-Set the target voltage unit to output.
	
To install:
	-Download the latest OscilloCalc.apk from the BUILDS/ folder
